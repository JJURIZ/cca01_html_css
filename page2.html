        <h1>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love!</h1>
<p>Thank you, steal again. I was saying "Boo-urns." How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</p>
<p>Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. <strong> How is education supposed to make me feel smarter?</strong> <em> Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain.</em> Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</p>
<h2>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</h2>
<p>You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</p>
<ol>
<li>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico?</li><li>I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.</li><li>I stand by my racial slur.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people.</h3>
<p>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? I hope I didn't brain my damage. Thank you, steal again. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.</li><li>Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</li><li>No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker.</p>
<p>Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face!</p>
<p>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems.</p>
<p>Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</p>
<p>Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</p>
<p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.</p>
<p>Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Thank you, steal again. That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.</p>
<p>Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box…</p>
<p>Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</p>
<p>Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</p>
