            <h1>Week 1 Demo Site</h1>
            <article>
                <h1>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</h1>
                <p>One hundred dollars. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</p>
                <p>I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! <strong> I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.</strong> <em> This is the worst part.</em> The calm before the battle.</p>
                <h2>And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</h2>
                <p>All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! We're rescuing ya. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Bite my shiny metal ass.</li><li>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</li><li>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</h3>
                <p>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! I'm a thing. Say what? How much did you make me?</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</li><li>I had more, but you go ahead.</li><li>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Kif might! Who are you, my warranty?! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</p>
                <p>You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Shinier than yours, meatbag. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Now what? Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!</p>
                <p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Oh yeah, good luck with that. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?</p>
                <p>It's a T. It goes "tuh". In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Soon enough. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</p>
                <p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. You're going to do his laundry? That's not soon enough! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Kids have names?</p>
                <p>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Professor, make a woman out of me. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
                <p>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. They're like sex, except I'm having them!</p>
                <p>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</p>
                <p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? And I'm his friend Jesus. Can I use the gun?</p>
                <p>You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Leela's gonna kill me. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</p>
                <p>Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Guess again. Why did you bring us here? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</p>
